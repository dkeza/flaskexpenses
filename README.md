I am creating this web app to learn Python and Flask Webframework.

It should be possible that users can log in, and create accounts.
For every account should be possible to enter incomes and expenses.

## Internationalization

To add new language:

```
flask translate init <language-code>
```

To update translations

```
flask translate update
```

To compile all languages

```
flask translate compile
```
